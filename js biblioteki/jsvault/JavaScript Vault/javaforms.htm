<td valign=top>This is an e-mail address validation function. It allows the usual user@domain syntax, but in addition allows user@[ip] format as well as &quot;User with Spaces&quot;@domain or [ip], all of which are legal syntax, according to W3C. It also checks that the user hasn't done anything silly like having multiple @'s or continuous .'s in the address (e.g. jim@b@c.com and jim@c..b.co.uk).
