</td></tr><tr>
<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/born-on-date.htm>Born On Date</a></td>
<td valign=top>In place of the boring &quot;Last Updated&quot; script, you can use this script. It does everything and more - it gives the page title, the day the page was last updated, and if the page has been updated since the visitor's last visit all in a cool little table!

</td></tr><tr>
<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/content-protector.htm>Content Protector</a></td>
<td valign=top>If your content page is loaded directly (not in frames) the page is reloaded in your frames. And to the aid of webmasters everywhere, this script also foils other sites loading your content page in their frames. Visitors are notified of the bandwidth theft then are sent to the page on your site (if used with our Dynamic Frameset script) or back to your main page.
</td></tr><tr>
<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/crazy-window.htm target=new>Crazy Window</a></td>

<td valign=top>Displaying links as new for a few weeks after adding them is great. But, adding, removing, and updating that "New" icon for each link is pointless! Let JavaScript do your work for you!
