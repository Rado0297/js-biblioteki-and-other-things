</td></tr><tr>
<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/browser-details.htm>Browser Details</a></td>
<td valign=top>If your visitors are not quite sure the details of the browser they are using, you can show them with the neat little script. The script will produce a table that shows the browser name, version, code name, and user agent.
</td></tr><tr>
<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/browser-info.htm>Browser Info</a></td>
<td valign=top>This script does a great job of displaying information about your web browser including version, your computer's platform, if Java is enabled, how many pages you've visited, and screen resolution
</td></tr><tr>
<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/browser-name.htm>Browser Name</a></td>
<td valign=top>How would you like to know the &quot;hi-tech&quot; browser name for you web browser?
</td></tr><tr>
<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/browser-properties.htm>Browser Properties</a></td>
<td valign=top>More information about the web browser than you knew existed! Find out the code name, color depth, platform, if java is enabled, resolution, ip address, hostname, and more!
</td></tr><tr>
<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/browser-version.htm>Browser Version</a></td>

</td></tr><tr>
<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/browser-version-redirect.htm>Browser Version Redirect</a></td>
<td valign=top>If you maintain separate pages for Netscape and Internet Explorer browsers and want to additionally divide each browser's page into version pages, this script is for you. The script will create a link (or can be changed to automatically redirect) to browser[version number].html. (For example, a visitor with Netscape 4.5 would see a link to netscape4.html)
</td></tr><tr>
<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/css-support-redirect.htm>Css Support Redirect</a></td>
<td valign=top>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are supported in version 4.0 and new browsers. So, you can easily redirect visitors to your site who have CSS (those with version 4.0+ browsers) to your CSS page, and send everyone else who doesn't have CSS to a normal page without CSS.
</td></tr><tr>
<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/history.htm>History</a></td>
<td valign=top>Shock your visitors by telling them how many sites they have been to since they began using their browser!

</td></tr><tr>

</td></tr><tr>
<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/ip.htm>Ip Grabber</a></td>
<td valign=top>(Netscape only, and Java must be enabled) Whether it's ethical or not, getting information on your site's visitors is just plain neat. As one of the most requested scripts, this little gem will allow you to get the user's IP address!
</td></tr><tr>
<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/ip-filter.htm>Ip Filter</a></td>
<td valign=top> (Netscape 4.0+ with Java enabled only!) JavaScript can prevent visitors with certain IP addresses from visiting your site. Simply enter part of their IP address (the more you enter the greater the chance only the intended person will not be able to enter your site) and they will not be able to enter the site.
</td></tr><tr>
<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/java-enabled-redirect.htm>Java Enabled Redirect</a></td>
<td valign=top>If Java is enabled in the visitor's browser, they are redirected to a Java-enhanced page. Otherwise, if Java is disabled they are sent to the non-java page.

<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/javascript-version.htm>Javascript Version</a></td>

</td></tr><tr>
<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/javascript-enabled-redirect.htm>Javascript Enabled Redirect</a></td>
<td valign=top>If your visitor has JavaScript enabled in their browser, they are automatically redirected to your JavaScript-enhanced page. If their browser doesn't support JavaScript or they have it disabled, the NOSCRIPT code will display a link to another page without JavaScript.
</td></tr><tr>
<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/language.htm>Language</a></td>
<td valign=top>(Version 4.0+ browsers) Redirects a user to the page based on their language. For example, English language user browsers, which report the language as 'en' in most cases, can be redirected to an English page, while Spanish language user browser, which report the language as 'es' in most cases, can be sent to a separate Spanish page. This method works well for redirecting users in all the languages that you set up. Instructions on adding more languages are included in the source code.
</td></tr><tr>
<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/must-visit-from.htm>Must Visit From</a></td>
<td valign=top>If other sites links directly the sub-pages of your site or if previous required pages are being skipped, you can now require your visitors to come from a certain page! Those that did not come from the required page are alerted then send back to the required previous page.
</td></tr><tr>
<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/optimized-popup.htm>Optimized Popup</a></td>

<td valign=top>JavaScript will count how many plugins are installed then make a remark based on that count to your visitors - totally written in JavaScript!
</td></tr><tr>
<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/plugin-page.htm>Plugin Page</a></td>
<td valign=top>If you maintain separate pages, one plugin enhanced, the other not, here's a simple way to send your visitors to the right page automatically. Besides being a very short script (it loads fast) you can modify the code to look for any plugin you want.
</td></tr><tr>
<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/referrer.htm>Referrer</a></td>

<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/resolution-image.htm>Resolution Image</a></td>
<td valign=top>(Version 4.0+ Browsers) Loads an image with different dimensions based on the users screen resolution setting. Higher resolution browsers see an image with increased dimensions and lower resolution browsers see an image with decreased dimensions. This separation ensures that each browser sees the image size that looks best in their browser.
</td></tr><tr>
<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/right-browser.htm>Right Browser</a></td>
<td valign=top>How do you let your visitors know that they do or do not have the right browser to view your site? Use this JavaScript! It'll tell them if they are using the right browser and the right version, or not....

So, when you design a site or create an image, be sure to use the &quot;browser-safe&quot; colors!
</td></tr><tr>
<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/screen-percentage.htm>Screen Percentage</a></td>

<td valign=top>Do you just not like the browser and computer &quot;user agent&quot; line that the web browsers use? This neat script (written by Netscape!) actually converts the user agent line into a more &quot;user friendly&quot; form, indicating the user's computer platform, browser version, and more!
</td></tr><tr>
<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/style-sheets-by-resolution.htm>Style Sheets By Resolution</a></td>
