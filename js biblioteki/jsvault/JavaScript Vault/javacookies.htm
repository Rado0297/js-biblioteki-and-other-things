<td valign=top>Redirects the visitor to different pages based on the value of a stored cookie. If no cookie is found, the available items are displayed for the user to pick from, which sets a cookie for their next visit. Our demonstration uses a 'favorite animal' cookie, but this could easily be modified to fit your needs.
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top>This cookies records the visitor's name and also writes the visitor's browser information to the screen.

</td></tr><tr>
<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/only-popup-once.htm>Only Popup Once.</a></td>
<td valign=top>If you have a new window open up on your home page, it opens every time your visitors come back to that page. This is rude as well as very annoying thing to force onto your visitors. But, using cookies, this script can determine if the visitor has been here before, and only open a new window on their first visit to the page. The next time they come back, the script will read the cookie, identify them as a repeat visitor, and NOT open the window again.
</td></tr><tr>
<td width=20% valign=top><a class="other" href=scripts/remove-ads.htm>Remove Ads.</a></td>
